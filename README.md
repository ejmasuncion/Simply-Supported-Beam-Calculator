# Simply-Supported-Beam-Calculator


# This is a calculator for solving simply supported beams that is typically used in Civil Engineering.
# It involves the concept of Equilibrium of Force Systems.
# For every loads that will be applied to the beam, it will generate an equal ammount of reactions from the supports.

# The program involves three parts.
# First is the input of length of the beam and the forces that will be applied.
# Second is to store the data in a dictionary.
# Last is the computation of the reactions of the two supports.
